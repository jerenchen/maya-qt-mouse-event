# maya-qt-mouse-event
A simple C++ example plugin demonstrating how to handle the Qt mouse button events in Maya.

Autodesk does not provide a CMake module for Maya so you will need something like [FindMaya.cmake](frarees.github.com/maya-cmake) in order to build the plugin without modifying [CMakelists.txt](CMakeLists.txt).
